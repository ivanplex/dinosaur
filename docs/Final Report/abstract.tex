\section*{Abstract}
The purpose of this project is to build a household real-time synchronous wireless multimedia system(RT-SWMS) and potentially explore the limitation of such a system. The timeline for this project is roughly separated into two parts. Real-time wireless network protocol using multicast and synchronization under UDP multicasting environment. So far a multicast protocol is implemented by using an adapted version of the Scalable Reliable Multicast. Furthermore, changes should be made in order to develope a synchronous system.
