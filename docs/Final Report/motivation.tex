The basic requirements for this project are already descibed by the project title, nevertheless I should formally define the specification for a successful project.\\

\begin{enumerate}  
\item The audio from the server must be streamed at real-time to the clients
\item While the server is casting, the entire system as a whole should attempt synchronzing all client's audio output

\item The third etc
\end{enumerate}
