\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this project is to build a household real-time synchronous wireless multimedia system(RT-SWMS) and potentially explore the limitation of such a system. The system consists of many nodes in a network all connected to a home router using WiFi. Each of this node is modeled by a Raspberry Pi Zero connected to a portable speaker and listen to a multicast server in the same private network. However, unlike Peercasting \cite{Peercasting:1}, which is multicasting via peer-to-peer technology, our system uses IP Multicast in a private network and therefore will follow the classic client-server model. Each node will return an acknowledgment back to the server upon receiving each datagram, such response time will be measured and the server will attempt to synchronize all nodes base on the delay in acknowledgement.
