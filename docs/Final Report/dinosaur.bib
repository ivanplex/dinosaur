abstract = { It is shown in this paper that the iterative algorithm introduced by Berlekamp for decoding BCH codes actually provides a general solution to the problem of synthesizing the shortest linear feedback shift register capable of generating a prescribed finite sequence of digits. The shift-register approach leads to a simple proof of the validity of the algorithm as well as providing additional insight into its properties. The equivalence of the decoding problem for BCH codes to a shift-register synthesis problem is demonstrated, and other applications for the algorithm are suggested.},

Really, it's all about the terminology. Get that down, and you'll actually understand a lot more and be able to hold a conversation with Joe D'Appolito himself (it's OK if you don't get that reference, just roll with me here). I'm going to teach you how to speak “home theater” like a pro. All you need to do is study up on the base terms. To do that, I've constructed a home theater glossary, including an example of how to use each word in a sentence. Armed with this, you can talk your way into being the guy who's in-the-know when it comes to all things home theater. Or at least you'll be able to fake your way through a conversation.},

@unpublished{Simpson2000,
abstract = {Many networked games use a form of dead-reckoning to avoid extraneous synchronization and minimize apparent latency. This technique may be improved by synchronizing the clocks on all machines within acceptable limits. Clock synchronization is non-trivial when the effects of variable latency are introduced such as on the global Internet. Extremely robust but slow-to-converge synchronization techniques such as NTP [MILLS92] have been proposed and developed by Mills, et al. Simpler alternatives are also in use such as SNTP [MILLS96]. Both of the protocols have deployment problems for computer games such as the fact that they are both data-gram based (UDP) [POSTEL80-1] as well as are either complex (NTP) or too-inaccurate (SNTP). This paper proposes an extremely simple alternative to Mills' NTP latency integration approach which, while substantially less accurate than NTP, is suitable for many network games and can be used on top of a stream-oriented protocol such as TCP [POSTEL80-2].},
